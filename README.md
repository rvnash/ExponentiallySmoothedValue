# ExponentiallySmoothedValue

A class to provide exponential smoothing to a signal, likely a time series of values from a sensor 

This library defines a class which performs exponential smoothing on a series of samples of a signal from a sensor. It implements the algorithm described here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_smoothing#Basic_exponential_smoothing .

Refer to ExampleExponentiallySmoothedValue.ino and ExponentiallySmoothedValue.h for a full description of how to use this library.

## Usage

Connect Particle hardware, add the ExponentiallySmoothedValue library to your project and follow this simple example: ExampleExponentiallySmoothedValue.ino
